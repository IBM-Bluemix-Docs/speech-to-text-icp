# Managing custom acoustic models
{: #manageAcousticModels}

The customization interface offers the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations` method for creating a custom acoustic model. For more information, see [Create a custom acoustic model](/docs/services/speech-to-text-icp/acoustic-create.html#createModel).
{: shortdesc}

The interface also offers the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/train` method for training a custom model on its latest audio resources. For more information, see [Train the custom acoustic model](/docs/services/speech-to-text-icp/acoustic-create.html#trainModel).

In addition, the interface includes methods for

-   Listing information about custom acoustic models
-   Resetting a custom acoustic model to its initial state
-   Deleting a custom acoustic model

## Listing custom acoustic models
{: #listModels}

The customization interface provides two methods for listing information about custom acoustic models:

-   The `GET /v1/acoustic_customizations` method lists information about all custom acoustic models or about all custom acoustic models for a specified language.
-   The `GET /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}` method lists information about a specified custom acoustic model. Use this method to poll the service about the status of a training request.

Both methods return the following information about a custom acoustic model:

-   `customization_id` identifies the custom model's Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). The GUID is used to identify the model in methods of the interface.
-   `created` is the date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) at which the custom model was created.
-   `language` is the language of the custom model.
-   `owner` identifies the credentials of the owner of the custom model.
-   `name` is the name of the custom model.
-   `description` shows the description of the custom model, if one was provided at its creation.
-   `base_model_name` indicates the name of the language model for which the custom model was created.
-   `versions` provides a list of the available versions of the custom model. Each element of the array indicates a version of the base model with which the custom model can be used. Multiple versions exist only if the custom model is upgraded. Otherwise, only a single version is shown.

The methods also return a `status` field that indicates the state of the custom model:

-   `pending` indicates that the model was created. It is waiting either for training data to be added or for the service to finish analyzing data that was added.
-   `ready` indicates that the model contains audio data and is ready to be trained.
-   `training` indicates that the model is being trained on audio data.
-   `available` indicates that the model is trained and ready to use with recognition requests.
-   `upgrading` indicates that the model is being upgraded.
-   `failed` indicates that training of the model failed. Examine the model's audio resources to determine what prevented the model from being trained. Possible errors include not enough audio, too much audio, or an invalid audio resource.

Additionally, the output includes a `progress` field that indicates the current progress of the custom model's training. If you used the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/train` method to start training the model, this field indicates the current progress of that request as a percentage complete. At this time, the value of the field is `100` if the status is `available`; otherwise, it is `0`.

### Example requests and responses
{: #listExample}

The following example includes the `language` query parameter to list all US English custom acoustic models:

```bash
curl -X GET -u "apikey:{apikey}"
"https://{icp_cluster_host}{:port}/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations?language=en-US"
```
{: pre}

Two models exist. The first model is awaiting data or is being processed by the service. The second model is fully trained and ready for use.

The following example returns information about the custom model that has the specified customization ID:

```bash
curl -X GET -u "apikey:{apikey}"

## Resetting a custom acoustic model
{: #resetModel}

Use the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/reset` method to reset a custom acoustic model. Resetting a custom model removes all of the audio resources from the model, initializing the model to its state at creation. The method does not delete the model itself or metadata such as its name and language. However, when you reset a model, its audio resources are removed and must be re-created.

### Example request
{: #resetExample}

The following example resets the custom acoustic model with the specified customization ID:

```bash
curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}"
"https://{icp_cluster_host}{:port}/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/reset"
```
{: pre}

## Deleting a custom acoustic model
{: #deleteModel}

Use the `DELETE /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}` method to delete a custom acoustic model that you no longer need. The method deletes all audio that is associated with the custom model and the model itself. Use this method with caution: A custom model and its data cannot be reclaimed after you delete the model.

### Example request
{: #deleteExample}

The following example deletes the custom acoustic model with the specified customization ID:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -u "apikey:{apikey}"
"https://{icp_cluster_host}{:port}/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}"
```
{: pre}
